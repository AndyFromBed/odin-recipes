    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>A tasty dish of potato chips one on one</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 potato, sliced paper thing(peel optional)</li>
      <li>Â½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Lightly grease a large dinner plate with cooking spray; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour oil into a plastic bag (a produce bag works well). Add potato
        slices and shake to coat. Arrange potato slices in a single layer on the
        prepared plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook in the microwave on high until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes.
        Remove chips to a large bowl and toss with salt. Chips will crisp as
        they cool. Repeat with remaining potato slices; no need to grease the
        plate again.
